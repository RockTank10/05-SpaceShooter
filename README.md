# 05-SpaceShooter
You play as a space ship and you must destory enemy cargo ships.
Look out for meteors though.
The window closes 1 second after all enemies are dead or the player runs into a meteor or enemy.
The players ship is controlled by the mouse.

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 how to replace the enemy with an explosion sprite when the enemy dies

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

they used mouse motion which I did not and maybe could've

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

I'd say killing the explosion image would be the biggest thing I'd alter

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Nothing really. Everything was pretty representative of the repositories leading up to this project.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

Nope

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

yessir

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The read.me pretty much explains the game which isn't super complicated to warrant anything more

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

You did a good job with adding both enemies and obstacles to watch out for which I personally didn't do and should've so cudos to you (no idea if I spelled cudos right but I'm too lazy to google....you get my point)
